During the Summer Camp of 2018 at Luong Van Chanh High School for the Gifted in Phu Yen province, I had the opportunity to attend geometry classes led by Professor Tran Quang Hung. The classroom dynamic was unconventional: the professor would present a problem on the board, and as we, a group of about 100 students, pondered over the solutions, he would circulate the room, occasionally stopping to discuss the problem with individual students. Unlike traditional classes, there were no students presenting solutions at the board; the room was filled predominantly with the professor's voice, with occasional murmurs of discussion among us.

I documented these class notes and shared them on a Facebook group called "Hinh hoc phang" after returning home from the camp in my 11th grade. The following year, as a 12th grader, I returned to the camp. To my surprise, Professor Hung inquired about the presence of Nguyen Kim Phuong Trangâ€”the author of the meticulous notes he had praised. Although I was too shy to identify myself, his acknowledgment filled me with joy, knowing that my work had reached and impressed him.

Now, as a Software Engineer, six years removed from those geometry-filled days, I no longer solve such problems. Nonetheless, my passion for geometry remains a cherished aspect of my past, a testament to the time I joyfully dedicated to unraveling geometric mysteries.
