# A simplified database system environment
![simplified-database-system](/images/2024-03-12-simplified-database-system.png)

A database management system (DBMS) is a computerized system that enables users to create and maintain a database. The DBMS is a general-purpose software system that facilitates the processes of defining, constructing, manipulating, and sharing databases among various users and applications. Defining a database involves specifying the data types, structures, and constraints of the data to be stored in the database. The database definition or descriptive information is also stored by the DBMS in the form of a database catalog or dictionary; it is called meta-data. Constructing the database is the process of storing the data on some storage medium that is controlled by the DBMS. Manipulating a database includes functions such as querying the database to retrieve specific data, updating the data- base to reflect changes in the miniworld, and generating reports from the data. Sharing a database allows multiple users and programs to access the database simultaneously.

An application program accesses the database by sending queries or requests for data to the DBMS. A query typically causes some data to be retrieved; a transaction may cause some data to be read and some data to be written into the database.

# Three levels of data abstraction

Since many database-system users are not computer trained, developers hide the complexity from users through several levels of data abstraction, to simplify usersâ€™ interactions with the system:
- **Physical level**. The lowest level of abstraction describes how the data are actually stored. The physical level describes complex low-level data structures in detail.
- **Logical level**. The next-higher level of abstraction describes what data are stored in the database, and what relationships exist among those data. The logical level thus describes the entire database in terms of a small number of relatively simple structures. Although implementation of the simple structures at the logical level may involve complex physical-level structures, the user of the logical level does not need to be aware of this complexity. This is referred to as physical data independence. Database administrators, who must decide what information to keep in the database, use the logical level of abstraction.
- **View level**. The highest level of abstraction describes only part of the entire database. Even though the logical level uses simpler structures, complexity remains because of the variety of information stored in a large database. Many users of the database system do not need all this information; instead, they need to access only a part of the database. The view level of abstraction exists to simplify their interac- tion with the system. The system may provide many views for the same database.

# Two-tier and three-tier architectures
![tier-architectures](/images/2024-03-12-two-three-tier-architecture.png)

Consider the architecture of applications that use databases as their back-end. Database applications can be partitioned into two or three parts. Earlier-generation database applications used a two-tier architecture, where the application resides at the client machine, and invokes database system functionality at the server machine through query language statements.

In contrast, modern database applications use a three-tier architecture, where the client machine acts as merely a front end and does not contain any direct database calls; web browsers and mobile applications are the most commonly used application clients today. The front end communicates with an application server. The application server, in turn, communicates with a database system to access data. The business logic of the application, which says what actions to carry out under what conditions, is embedded in the application server, instead of being distributed across multiple clients. Three- tier applications provide better security as well as better performance than two-tier applications.
