# 1. Three levels of data abstraction

Since many database-system users are not computer trained, developers hide the complexity from users through several levels of data abstraction, to simplify usersâ€™ interactions with the system:
- **Physical level**. The lowest level of abstraction describes how the data are actually stored. The physical level describes complex low-level data structures in detail.
- **Logical level**. The next-higher level of abstraction describes what data are stored in the database, and what relationships exist among those data. The logical level thus describes the entire database in terms of a small number of relatively simple structures. Although implementation of the simple structures at the logical level may involve complex physical-level structures, the user of the logical level does not need to be aware of this complexity. This is referred to as physical data independence. Database administrators, who must decide what information to keep in the database, use the logical level of abstraction.
- **View level**. The highest level of abstraction describes only part of the entire database. Even though the logical level uses simpler structures, complexity remains because of the variety of information stored in a large database. Many users of the database system do not need all this information; instead, they need to access only a part of the database. The view level of abstraction exists to simplify their interac- tion with the system. The system may provide many views for the same database.

# 2. Two-tier and three-tier architectures

Consider the architecture of applications that use databases as their back-end. Database applications can be partitioned into two or three parts. Earlier-generation database applications used a two-tier architecture, where the application resides at the client machine, and invokes database system functionality at the server machine through query language statements.

In contrast, modern database applications use a three-tier architecture, where the client machine acts as merely a front end and does not contain any direct database calls; web browsers and mobile applications are the most commonly used application clients today. The front end communicates with an application server. The application server, in turn, communicates with a database system to access data. The business logic of the application, which says what actions to carry out under what conditions, is embedded in the application server, instead of being distributed across multiple clients. Three- tier applications provide better security as well as better performance than two-tier applications.
